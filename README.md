## Introduction
This project is part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program in collaboration with IBM.

In this project, we will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles we think they will like.

## Our Tasks
The project is divided into the following tasks:

### i. Exploratory Data Analysis
Before making recommendations of any kind, we will need to explore the data we are working with for the project. Dive in to see what we can find. There are some basic, required questions to be answered about the data we are working with throughout the rest of the notebook. This space is used to explore, before we dive into the details of our recommendation system in the later sections.
